you can run "Little Geek."

326
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:05,461
Goddamn it. You know McWorter
can't run an R.O.V.

327
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:09,230
<i>- [One Night] Then you better go.</i>
- I'll go.

328
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:11,965
- Good!
- What is your problem, huh?

329
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:15,042
<i>On this dive, you'll do</i>
absolutely nothing...</i>

330
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:18,544
without direct orders from me, and you'll
follow those orders without discussion.

331
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:21,274
Is that clear?

332
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,283
<i>All right.</i>

333
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:26,115

ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

Hold it a second.

Hold it! Whoa!

337
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:42,268
Okay, here we go.
All right.

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,737
Look, um,
it's 3:00 a.m.

339
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,241
These guys are running on bad coffee
and about four hours of sleep.

340
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:53,280
- Maybe you could think about cutting them some slack.
- I can't afford slack.

341

Hey, you come on my rig.
You don't talk to me.

342

You start orderin' my people around.
It's not gonna work.

You got to know how to handle these people.
We got a way of doin' things around here.

344

Right now, I'm not interested
in your way of doing things.

345

ready to dive.

346

no sense of humor.

- Yeah, sure.

351

- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

352
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:40,817
- What is all this stuff? -
Fluid-breathing system. We just got them.

353
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:44,729
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

354
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,461
- Deep.
- How deep?

355
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:52,336
It's classified. Anyway, you breathe
liquid so you can't get compressed.

356
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,634
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

357
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:59,119
- Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit.

358
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:02,829
Check this out.

359

- What are you doin'?

- Hey, no, no, no.
- You're gonna kill her!

361
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:13,271
- It's okay. I've done this myself.
- Are you just drownin' her?

362
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:15,278
She's gonna be fine.

363
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,848
I've breathed this myself.
It's gonna be fine.

364
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:20,611
No, man. She's gonna drown!
Look! She's freakin' out!

<i>- She's gonna drown!</i>
- He's taking the fluid into his lungs.</i>

367
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:31,627
He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

368
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:37,233
There he goes.
There's a bit of anxiety here.

369
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:40,793
<i>Now he's starting to relax.</i>
He's breathing fine.</i>

370
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:43,738
<i>See his chest moving?</i>
He's getting plenty of oxygen.</i>

371
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:46,401
<i>Ha. Damn rat's</i>
breathin'that shit.</i>

372
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:51,244
That is no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.

373
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:54,750
See, the fluid's harder to push in
and out than air.

374
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:57,980
<i>It's a little more work to breathe,</i>
but he's doing fine.</i>

375
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,990
- He's diggin' it.
- She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.

376
00:28:01,092 --> 00:28:02,753
Let her out now. Now!

377
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,454
Okay. All right.

378
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:09,294
Okay, now we let
the fluid drain from his lungs.

379
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,925
All right. Give her here.
Give her. Give her.

380

- It's a she.

have sprung. Radiation's nominal.

- 24 trident missiles. 8 MI RVs per missile.

[Breathing Heavily]

485
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:05,866
Hey, Jammer.

486
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:09,533
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! You okay?

487
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,701
Deep and slow,

488
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:14,143
Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.

489

Everybody's dead!
They're all dead.

490
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,380
- I'm taking you back out. Let's go.
- No!

491
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:21,716
I'm okay. I'm okay.

492
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:30,256
- I just can't go any further in.
- Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here.

493
00:39:30,363 --> 00:39:33,491
I've got to check out
this compartment, all right?

494
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,661
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold on the end of this rope here.

495
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:41,969
- You have any problem whatsoever, you tug twice.
- I got it.

496
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:46,375
Pull it hard. Five more minutes.
Just relax. You'll be okay.

497
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,073
- Okay.
- Be right back.

Okay, just a few
more minutes.

00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:50,891
There's a couple compartments
up ahead that might have air.

<i>- Okay, no problem.</i>
- We got to be sure, right?

<i>- What's the problem?</i>
- He's convulsing!

It's his mixture.
Too much oxygen.

520
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:58,643
Got to get the O-2 cut down!
Turn him over!

521
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:01,849
Crank it down, man!
You're losin' him!

522
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:08,786
All right. We got to get him
out of here. Let's go. Let's move it.

Easy, big fella.
That's it.

Are they out yet?

525
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:19,932
Negative, Lindsey.
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

526
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:23,842
Let's give them two minutes more max,
and then I'll sound a diver recall...

527
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:46,759
[Bud Over Radio]
Lindsey, do you copy?

528
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,965
Meet me at Flatbed. This is a diver
emergency. Linds, do you copy?

529
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:54,201
Uh, yeah, copy you, Bud.
L- I'm on my way.

530
00:43:59,682 --> 00:44:04,619
Look, I'm just a medic,
which is mostly about patchin' holes.

531
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,817
This type of thing, it's...
There's not much I can do.

532
00:44:09,926 --> 00:44:12,827
A coma could last
hours or days.

533
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:22,269
So you didn't get
anything on the cameras.

534
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,703
No. I didn't get
a picture of it.

535
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:26,934
- What about the video?
- No.

536
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:31,912
We lost power right then. Look, I just
don't want to talk about this, okay?

537
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:34,676
Fine. Be that way.

538
00:44:34,784 --> 00:44:37,218
Look, I don't know
what I saw, Bud, okay?

539
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,450
Coffey wants to call it a Russian
submersible, fine, it's a Russian submersible.

540
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:46,085
- No problem.
- Yeah, but you think it was somethin' else.

541
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:49,858
What?
One of ours?

542
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:56,204
- No.
- Well, whose then?

543
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,303
Come on, Lindsey,
talk to me.

544
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,244
Look, Jammer saw something down there,
something that scared the hell out of him.

545
00:45:05,348 --> 00:45:08,977
His mixture got screwed up.
Jammer panicked.

546
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:11,645
He pranged his regulator,
and his mixture got screwed up.

547
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:14,188
But what did he see
that made him panic?

548
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:18,193
Well, what do you
think he saw?

549
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:22,460
I don't know.

550
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:26,626
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

551
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:28,704
It could have been
a Russian bogey.

552
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:33,571
Oh, Cinclantfleet's
gonna go ape shit.

553
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:37,772
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked within 50 miles of here.

554
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,281
<i>Now they don't know</i>
where the hell they are. Okay.</i>

00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:44,376
[Sighs]
I haven't got any choice.

556
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,853
I'm confirming you
to go to phase two.

one warhead, arm it...</i>

<i>and wait for</i>

559
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:56,275
- We got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

560
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:01,013
- [Whistles] Better come on.
- Turn it up, folks.

561
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,247
<i>Sources have not confirmed any reports
that the Montana</i> encountered...

562
00:46:04,356 --> 00:46:07,416
a Soviet fast-attack sub
prior to its sinking,

563
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:10,551
and the Kremlin continues
to deny any involvement.

564
00:46:10,662 --> 00:46:12,755
Oh, that's us.
That's us, man.

565
00:46:12,864 --> 00:46:16,459
Benthic Petroleum are apparently
participating in the recovery operation,

566
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:19,002
but we have little information
about their involvement.

567
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:21,572
Bullshit.
We want names.

<i>- That's the</i> Explorer. We're famous.</i>
- Shh, quiet.</i>

There is a tremendous
amount of activity.

570

With Cuba only 80 miles away,

571
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:32,878
the massive buildup
of American forces...

572
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:36,249
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

573
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:40,916
<i>Russian and Cuban trawlers,</i>

Hippy, what's the matter
with you?

577
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:51,567
What's the matter with me?
Nothing.

00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:54,570
We're just in the middle
of some big-time international incident,

579
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:56,640
like the Cuban missile crisis
or something.

580
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,868
Figured that out for yourself,
did you, Hip?

581
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:00,877
We got Russian subs
creepin' around.

582
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:04,881
Anything goes wrong, they could say
whatever they want happened.

583
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:07,474
Relax, will you?
You're makin' the women nervous.

584
00:47:07,585 --> 00:47:12,215
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, those SEALs ain't telling us diddly.

Shit! Coffey! Come back!

593
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:38,073
We need the big arm
to unhook the umbilical.

Tell those men to get below
and stay there.

598
00:48:01,306 --> 00:48:04,036

No problem, except your boys

- Two hours?

We're gonna get the shit kicked
out of us by our pal Fred in two hours.

- Set cold tab fitting to 200 P.S.I.
- Set.

There she goes. She's breaking loose.
Bringing her up.

606
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:35,596
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

607
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:41,543
Get clear of the hatch. Keep goin'
with it. Keep goin'. That's it, up.

looks intact.

claimed that the collision...

an unprovoked attack.

It's all yours, sir.

621
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:24,383
- Swing it away and drop it.
- Check. Okay.

Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

- Separation sequencer disconnected.

Sometime this morning, all U.S. And NATO
military forces have been put on full alert.

Well, you just
feel so helpless.

You can see it coming, but what
can you do? What can anyone do?

Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.
So why are we doin' this?

If it happens,
it happens.

There's nothing I can do about it,
right? I just don't think about it.

637
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:45,984
All right. Let's get their gear off!
Then clear the sub.

a little pressed for time.

Prick. This ain't no drill,
slick. Make me proud.

There is something down there.
Something not us.

You could be more... specific.

- Not us.

Not human. Get it?

851
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:50,100
Something nonhuman, but intelligent.

852
01:12:56,481 --> 01:13:00,349
A nonterrestrial intelligence.

853
01:13:00,452 --> 01:13:03,012
- A nonterrestrial intelligence.
- Yes.

854
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:06,352

Underwater flying objects.

Are we talking

Hell, yeah! Hot rods of the gods!
Right, Linds?

858
01:13:20,906 --> 01:13:22,999
No, really.
It could be N.T.I.s.

Stay off my side.

- Certainly.

I'm trying to keep this situation
under control.

- Nobody's hysterical!
- Shh.

All I'm saying is, when you're

you don't go
waving your arms around.

Look, I saw something. I'm not gonna
say I didn't see it when I did.

I'm sorry.
Please.

You are the most stubborn woman

Yes. I am.

But I need you
to believe me right now.

Come on, look at me.
Am I stressed out?

877
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:16,349
Do I have any symptoms of pressure

878
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:19,953
- No.
- No.

01:14:20,065 --> 01:14:23,091
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.
Okay?

880
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:27,035
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

881
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:29,368
Now watch my lips.

882
01:14:29,474 --> 01:14:32,534
I saw these things.

883
01:14:32,644 --> 01:14:34,544
I touched one of them,

884
01:14:34,646 --> 01:14:38,548
and it wasn't some clunky steel can
like we would build.

885
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:41,885
It glided.

886
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:46,055
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

887
01:14:47,392 --> 01:14:50,293
Oh, God,
I wish you'd been there.

888
01:14:50,395 --> 01:14:53,796
It was a machine...
It was a machine, but it was alive.

889
01:14:53,898 --> 01:14:56,492
It was like a...
like a dance of light.

890
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,971
Please. You have to trust me.

891
01:15:02,073 --> 01:15:05,702
Now, I don't think they mean us
any harm. I don't know how I know that.

892
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,677
It's just a feeling.

893
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,681
Geez. I'm supposed to
go on a feeling?

894
01:15:11,783 --> 01:15:14,684
How can I? You think Coffey's
gonna go on a feeling?

895
01:15:14,786 --> 01:15:18,085
Well, we all see
what we wanna see.

896
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:20,885
Coffey looks,
and he sees Russians.

897
01:15:20,992 --> 01:15:22,892
He sees hate and fear.

898
01:15:24,462 --> 01:15:27,693
You have to look
with better eyes than that.

01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:36,015

- I can't, Linds.

on his own,

his chain of command,

991
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:14,448
he's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis...

992

a nuclear weapon.

your tongue in neutral for a while.

No way that thing

They must have learned to control water.

They can plasticize it, polymerize it,

So, l... I can hear you,

467
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:40,948

- Yeah, no shit.

[Lindsey Over Radio]
You're doing fine.

517
00:47:03,812 --> 00:47:07,873
You'd better watch out for crane
wreckage. You should be almost to it.

518
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,519
Forty-eight hundred feet.
It's official.

519
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,529
Yeah.

520
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:26,431
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

521
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:30,369
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing
this when you got up this morning, huh?

522
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:42,274
One mile down.
Still grinnin'.

Eighty-five hundred feet, Bud.

Ensign Monk wants to know
how you feel.

It hits the nervous system first.

Keep talking.
Let him hear your voice.

Okay, Bud, your depth is 8,900 feet.
You're doing fine.

It's not easy
being a cast-iron bitch.

539
00:49:02,197 --> 00:49:05,098
Takes discipline
and years of training.

540

A lot of people
don't appreciate that.

541

tell you these things to your face.

Do you remember that time...

00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:38,628
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

581
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:43,792
The power went out in that little
apartment we had on Orange Street.

582
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:49,134
We were staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb, like,

583
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:52,140
"That candle is me," like...

584
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:57,009
like every one of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life.

585
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:00,649
And you just...

586
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:04,152
you just lit up another candle
and put it beside mine...

587
00:53:04,254 --> 00:53:07,155
and you said,
"No. See, that's me. That's me."

588
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,192
We stared at the two candles,

589
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:12,194
and then...

590
00:53:13,497 --> 00:53:15,328
Well, if you remember
any of this,

591
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:17,832
I'm sure you remember
the next part.

592
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:24,305

00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,889
by unscrewing it counterclockwise.

611
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:41,627
All right, Bud,
you have to cut the ground wire,

612
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:44,061
not the lead wire.

613
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:46,257
It's the blue wire
with the white stripe.

You drop your weights and start back
