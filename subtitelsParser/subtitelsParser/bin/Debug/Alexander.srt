1
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,300
Our world has gone now.

2
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:50,599
Smashed by the wars.

3
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Now I am the keeper of his body,

4
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,599
bound here in the Egyptian ways,

5
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,400
I followed him as Pharaoh, and have now ruled 40 years.

6
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,100
I am the victor. But what does it all mean?

7
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,399
When there is no one left to remember,

8
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
The great cavalry charge of Gaugamela, or the
mountains of the Hindu Kush,

9
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,600
When we crossed the 100,000 man army into India.

10
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,699
He was a God, Cadmos

11
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,000
or as close as anything I've ever seen.

12
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:38,300
"Tyrant!" they yelled so easily, I laugh.

13
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,799
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

14
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,600
And what do they know of the world, these school boys?

15
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,099
it takes strong man to rule.

16
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,900
Alexander was more, he was Prometheus, a friend to man,

17
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,799
He changed the world,

18
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,600
before him, there were tribes, and after him...

19
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,399
..all was possible.

20
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,500
There was suddenly a sense the world could be
ruled by one king... be better for all.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,500
18 Great Alexandrias he built, it was an empire
not of land and gold...

22
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,400
..but of the mind. Hellenic civilization.

23
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Open. To All!

24
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,900
How can I say it? How can I tell you what it is like to be young?

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,499
To dream, big dreams,

26
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,700
..to believe when Alexander looked you in the eye,

27
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:44,500
You could do anything. Anything!

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,800
In his presence, by the light of Apollo, we were better than ourselves.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Truly, I've known many great men in my life,

30
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,050
but only one colossus,

31
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,699
And only now in old

32
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,500
do I understand who this force of nature really was.

33
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,299
Or do I?

34
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,499
Did such a man as Alexander exist?

35
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,300
Of course not, they idolize him, make him better than he was.

36
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Men, all men reach and fall,

37
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,400
reach and fall.

38
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,000
The east, the vast Persian empire, ruled almost all the known world.

39
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,699
The west, once great greek city states,

40
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,500
Thebes, Athens, Sparta, had fallen from pride.

41
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,400
For a hundred years now, the persian kings had bribed the greeks with their gold,

42
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,299
To fight as mercenaries,

43
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,100
it was Philip, the one eyed, that changed all this.

44
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,900
Uniting tribes of illiterate sheep herders, from the high and low lands,

45
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:14,100
With his blood and guts, he built a professional army,

46
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:18,800
Brought the devious greeks to their knees.

47
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,799
He then turned his eye on Persia,

48
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,400
where it was said the new, great King Darius himself,

49
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:30,200
on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.

50
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,600
It was from these loins of war, that Alexander was born, in Pella.

51
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,699
Pella Macedonia

52
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,750
Some called his mother, Queen Olympias, a sorceress,

53
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:57,800
and said that Alexander was the child of Dionysus...

54
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,399
..others, Zeus.

55
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,200
But truly, there was not a man in Macedonia who didn't
look at father and son,

56
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,500
side by side, and wonder.

57
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,900
Trust the ones who give you love

58
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,900
life has just begun, son.

59
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,900
Her skin is water, her tongue is fire.

60
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,000
She's your friend

61
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,900
Take it,

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,300
If you hesitate she will strike,

63
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:57,600
Remember that, never hesitate.

64
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,400
Yes, they are like people, you can love them for years,

65
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,300
feed them, nurture them, but still,

66
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,000
they can turn on you.

67
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Come...

68
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,700
He calls me a barbarian! Philip makes a mockery of
Dionysus every night!

69
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Women are the only ones who know Dionysus.

70
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,000
My little Achilles.

71
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,300
Stay, Alexander, down.

72
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,399
What is it you..

73
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,300
6 months to this day.

74
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,699
No no, not here.

75
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,799
Drop, bitch, to your king,

76
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,600
King of what? Sheepherders? Men?

77
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,499
*laughing*

78
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,599
I, am of Achilles royal blood.

79
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
The blood of Heracles runs in my veins.

80
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,199
Your are nothing but a drunken whore.

81
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
You're a foul-mouthed tentative bitch from Hades,
And I curse the very name of you!

82
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,700
You think people respect you? You think they
dont know your bastards?

83
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,800
Damn your sorceress soul! Keep him here like one of your snakes?

84
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,300
I told you not! I told you not!

85
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,600
You'll obey me.

86
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,899
I will not.

87
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,700
You'll obey me or I'll kill you.. with my own hands.

88
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,500
Stop! Stop! Stop!

89
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,499
Your majesty! No!

90
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,800
..in the name of the Gods!

91
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,850
He will never be yours, NEVER!

92
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,900
In my womb I carried my avenger.

93
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,700
8 years later

94
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,900
In the world he grew up to, I have come to
believe it was in friendship,

95
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
..that Alexander found his sanity.

96
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,700
You don't need much to fight, when you're in the front
ranks of a battle...

97
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,000
..Facing some northern barbarian tribe. Courage won't
be in the lining of your stomach, Nearchus...

98
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,600
..it's in the heart of a man!

99
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,899
You dont need to eat everyday...or until you're full, Ptolemy..

100
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,700
..but only to lie in bed in the morning, when you
can have some good bean soup, Cassander...

101
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,200
..after a force night march. Come on, Alexander!
Come on!

102
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,900
Who'd ever respect you as a king? You
think it's because of your father?

103
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:35,300
The first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do:

104
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:40,100
no more, no less.

105
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,900
That's it, well done my student! Good wrestling!
That's what I want!

106
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,899
come come come...You did well but you lost,

107
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,700
..now both of you will congratulate the other. Go on!

108
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Would you want me to let you win, Alexander?

109
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Your right. But I promise you I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

110
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,200
It was said later that Alexander was never defeated

111
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:16,500
except by Hephaistion's thighs.

112
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:19,199
Although an inferior race,

113
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,000
the persians control at least four
fifths of the known world,

114
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,900
But is it possible, the source of Egypt's mighty river Nile,

115
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,100
could rise in these distance mountains of the outer earth?

116
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:37,900
If so, an experienced navigator could find his way,

117
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,099
here, by this river east,

118
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,699
down into the great plains of India,

119
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,500
Out into the eastern ocean, and into the world,

120
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:53,300
and by this route, up the Nile, back to Egypt,

121
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,500
into the middle sea, and home, to Greece.

122
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,100
Now if only these frogs could look outward
and act on their favorite position of the center,

123
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,899
Greece could rule the world.

124
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Why is it master, in myth these lands
you speak of are known?

125
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,599
India, where Heracles, and Dionysus traveled.

126
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,400
All these men who went east: Thesius,
Jason, Achilles...were victorious?

127
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
From generation to generation their stories
have been past on. Why?

128
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,500
..unless there was truth to them?

129
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,699
Tales of amazons?

130
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,500
No, Alexander, only common people believe these tales.

131
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,199
..As they believe most anything.

132
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,000
We are here precisely to educate ourselves
against such foolish passions.

133
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,200
But if we are superior to the persians as you say,

134
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,899
why do we not rule them?

135
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,700
It is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.

136
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,700
The east has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.

137
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Master, master...

138
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:04,550
Yes?

139
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:04,999
Master?

140
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,099
Out with it, out with it.

141
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,199
Why are the persians so cruel?

142
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,999
That is not the subject for today, Nearchus.

143
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,800
But it is true, the oriental races are known for their barbarity,

144
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:19,300
and their slavish devotion to their senses,

145
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:22,800
Excess in all things, is the undoing of men!

146
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,699
That is why we Greeks are superior.

147
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,100
We practice control of our senses,
moderation. We hope!

148
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,199
And what of Achilles at Troy master? Was he not excessive?

149
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,000
Achilles simply lacks restraint. He dominates
other men so completely,

150
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,799
that even when he withdraws from battle, crazed with grief,

151
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
..over his dead lover Patroclus, he seriously
endangers his own army!

152
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:49,199
He is a deeply selfish man.

153
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Then would you say that the love between
Achilles and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

154
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,200
When men lie together in lust, it is a
surrender to the passions,

155
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:01,499
and does nothing for the excellence in us,

156
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,300
..nor does any other excess, Cassander,
..jealousy among them,

157
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,800
but when men lie together and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them,

158
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,399
that is pure, and excellent,

159
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,099
when they compete to bring out the good,

160
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,599
the best in each other, this is the love between men,

161
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,400
that can build the city state and lift us
from our frog pond.

162
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,400
Philip brought such as Aristotle from Athens
to educate our rough people,

163
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:40,200
and growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.

164
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,900
Is that the best you can do, Cleitus?
Back to the phalanx with you!

165
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:49,799
I'll ride him myself!

166
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,600
No one can ride that beast your majesty.

167
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,499
He's been beaten far too often.

168
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,599
My noble king, he's a high spirited animal,
yeah.. HIGH SPIRITED!

169
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,100
..and worthy of Philip of Macedon. But for three and a half
coins...I couldn't possibly make a profit on him. But for you..

170
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,300
Why would I want such a beast? I already have a wife!

171
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,300
Do I seem so old?

172
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,500
A broken neck comes free, fool. He's too nervous
for battle. You'll sell him for meat.

173
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,900
Buy him for me father, I'll ride him.

174
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,299
And if you don't?

175
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500
I'll pay for him myself.

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,900
With what, your singing voice?

177
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,599
I'll pay you.

178
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,400
I tell you the horse can't be ridden lad, his mind is broken.

179
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,999
He can be ridden, by me.

180
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,800
If you can rule that horse I'll make
him yours! At half the price.

181
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:15,000
That horse will kill him Philip. It'll break the boy in two.

182
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:19,800
Really? Perhaps you'll make a musician out of him yet.

183
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,100
The boy does not have the craft, Philip.
He could hurt himself.

184
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:36,900
He will have to figure that out for himself. It's time.

185
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,999
You do not like your shadow. Do ya?

186
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It is like a dark spirit coming up sketchy,

187
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:53,599
See? That's us.

188
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,700
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

189
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:01,500
He's the god of, Sun.

190
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,000
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
..you and me together.

191
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,100
Bucephalus. That is what I'll call you... strong and stubborn.

192
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,299
Bucephalus and Alexander.

193
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,100
Come now, let's ride together.

194
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,999
Ahhhh, he's got some tight in 'em yet!

195
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Attalus, Cleitus, for Zeus's sake, he beat ya man!

196
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Now Bucephalus, show them.

197
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,000
My son, my son!

198
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,450
You remember Achilles?

199
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,200
He is my favorite.

200
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,899
Why?

201
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,500
Because he loved Patroclus and avenged his death.

202
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,299
And his fate?

203
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,700
That he must die young, but with great glory.

204
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,399
Did he have a choice?

205
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh yes: to live a long life, but there would be no glory.

206
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:42,999
You dream of glory Alexander, your mother encourages you.

207
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,800
There is no glory with out suffering, and this she will not allow.

208
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,299
One day I will be on walls like these.

209
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,100
Prometheus stole the secret of fire and gave it to man,

210
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,499
Made Zeus so angry,

211
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,350
he chained Prometheus to a rock in the Great Caucasas,

212
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:10,199
and each day, his eagle pecked out the poor man's liver,

213
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,700
each night it grew back again, so that it
could be eaten the next day,

214
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:19,500
miserable fate.

215
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,699
Why?

216
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,500
Who knows these things, anyway,

217
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,199
Oedipus, tore out his eyes,

218
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,000
He found out, he'd murdered his father,
and married his mother,

219
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,899
knowledge that came too late,

220
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,000
Medea. She slaughtered her two children in vengeance,

221
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:51,800
When Jason left her for a younger wife.

222
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,199
My mother would never hurt me.

223
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,499
Never easy to escape our mothers Alexander,

224
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,000
All your life, beware of women. They're
far more dangerous than men.

225
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,099
Heracles, even after he accomplished his 12 labors,

226
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,900
He was punished with madness, slaughtered his 3 children

227
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Poor Heracles. Great Heracles.

228
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,099
All greatness comes from loss.

229
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,900
Even you, the Gods will one day judge harshly.

230
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,550
When I'm king like you one day father.

231
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,800
Don't rush the day boy. You risk all!

232
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,000
My father threw me into battle before I knew how to fight.

233
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:57,800
When I'd killed my first man he said "Now you know"

234
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,899
I hated him then,

235
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,700
But I understand why now. A king isn't born Alexander,

236
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,700
He is made... by stealing, by suffering,

237
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:14,500
A king must know how to hurt those he loves.

238
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,250
It is lonely. Ask Heracles.

239
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,199
ask any of them! Fate is cruel.

240
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
No man or woman could be too powerful
or too beautiful, without disaster befalling.

241
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,899
They laugh when you rise too high,

242
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,499
..crush everything you built with the wind.

243
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,100
The glory they give, in the end..they take away.

244
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:46,900
They make of us slaves.

245
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,799
8 years later

246
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,899
Pregnant. So soon! The little whore..

247
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,350
You will marry her in the spring, during Dionysus' festival,

248
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,325
And when her first son is born, her sweet uncle Attalus,

249
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:27,300
Will convince Philip to name the boy, his successor,

250
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:29,700
With himself as regent.

251
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:31,799
And you,

252
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,699
you will be sent on some impossible mission,

253
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,200
Against some monstrous northern tribe, to be mutilated.

254
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:43,899
In one more meaningless battle over cattle.

255
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,700
And I, no longer queen, will be put to death with your sister,

256
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,999
And the remaining members of our family.

257
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,499
I wish, sometimes you could see the light mother.

258
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,300
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you have not been long without.

259
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,100
The only way is to strike. Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian, NOW.

260
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:10,599
Beget a child of pure blood,

261
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,599
he would be one of them, not mine,

262
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,800
And he would have no choice but to make you king,

263
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:19,799
..there is still Kynnane.

264
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig had not ravaged her first!

265
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:28,600
Say nothing more of my father!
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

266
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,900
Your right, forgive me,

267
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:39,600
a mother loves too much.

268
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,600
Who shall I sing to sleep at night anymore?

269
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,000
I wish, I wish we could spend more time together,

270
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,600
like we used to, when you were the sweetest boy.

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,799
There's never been time mother,

272
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,600
since I was a child, I have been groomed to be ever the best.

273
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,700
Aaw my poor child, like Achilles,

274
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:23,500
cursed by your greatness.

275
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,000
Take my strength.

276
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,900
You must never confuse your feelings with your duties, Alexander.

277
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,300
A king must make public gestures for the common people.

278
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:48,699
I know, but you will be 19 this summer,

279
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,800
and the girls already say you dont like them,

280
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:53,399
You like Hephaistion more,

281
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,899
I understand it is natural for a young man,

282
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,400
But if you go to Asia with out leaving your successor you risk all.

283
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:05,350
Hephaistion loves me,

284
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,300
..as I am, not who.

285
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,700
Loves? Loves?

286
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,999
In the name of Dionysus,

287
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,800
...understand how Philip thinks. For your own sake.

288
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,099
Your life hangs in the balance,

289
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,600
..his spies are inside your closest...

290
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:34,499
Stop!

291
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,600
I am his only worthy son, you crazed woman,

292
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,499
he would never hurt me,

293
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,300
Even if Eurydice had a boy, he'd be 20
before he would let him rule.

294
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,599
Yes, and you would be 40,

295
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,400
old and wise, like Parmenion, and Philip's young son would be 20,

296
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,399
Like you, now. But raised by him.

297
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,200
His blood. He will never give you the throne now, Alexander.

298
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,000
NEVER.

299
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,150
Ahhh, come Alexander drink this sadness away!

300
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:35,700
It's only thirst can quench sorrow, Ptolemy.

301
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,100
There is only one thing better than winning a battle son,

302
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:43,950
..and that's the taste of a new woman.

303
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,800
You'll find it far sweeter than self pity.

304
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,799
Pausianas, you bore me.

305
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,600
Alexander, Alexander I've found you the right girl.

306
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
What's your name?

307
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:55,899
Antigone.

308
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,600
Huh, what's your name?

309
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,999
Antigone.

310
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,950
I love you my lil' imp!

311
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,900
And I love you Cleitus.

312
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,300
Would you prefer a seat, Cleitus?

313
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,100
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

314
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:16,801
I prefer dancing!

315
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,499
A toast! a toast!

316
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,300
I drink to our great friends and to our new union,

317
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,500
Macedonia and Greece! Equals in greatness!

318
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,799
to Philip our King!

319
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,650
without whom this union could not be possible.

320
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:53,500
Come, Attalus! Leave some damn air in the hall!

321
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:56,699
And last I drink to the king's marriage..

322
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,500
to my niece, Eurydice. A Macedonian queen we can be proud of!

323
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,100
To Philip and Eurydice, and to their legitimate sons!

324
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,700
You son of a dog, come then!

325
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,700
This is my wedding not some public brawl!

326
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,899
Apologize by Zeus before you dishonor me.

327
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,600
You defend the man who called my mother a
whore and me a bastard!.. and I dishonor you?

328
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:51,400
Ah! You listen like your mother! Attalus is
my family now, the same as you.

329
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:53,999
Then choose your relatives more carefully.

330
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Don't expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.

331
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,399
Shame?

332
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,999
You insult me!

333
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,500
I insult you? Am I not fit to lick the ground my mother walks on?

334
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,599
You dog!.. questioning your queen!

335
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Shame? I have nothing to be ashamed of you arrogant brat,

336
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,799
I'll marry the girl if I want,

337
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,600
And I'll have as many sons as I want and there's
nothing you or your harpy mother could do about it!

338
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,400
Why, you drunken man, must you think everything
I do and say comes from my mother?

339
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,399
Because I know her heart, by Hera.

340
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,200
And I see her in your eyes. You come at this throne too much!

341
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,000
Now we all know that she-wolf of
a mother of yours wants me dead!

342
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,799
Well you can both dream, boy!

343
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,500
Come, Philip, this is the wine talking,
leave the boy! It'll wait 'til morning.

344
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:46,300
No, I command you!

345
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,500
Apologize to your kinsmen.

346
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Apologize!

347
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,900
NO kinsmen to me.

348
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,800
Goodnight old man, and when my mother re-marries,

349
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,100
I'll invite you to her wedding.

350
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:17,900
You bastard!

351
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,900
You'll obey me, come here!

352
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,300
And this is the man who is going to take you from Greece to Persia?

353
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:47,800
He can't even make it from one couch to the next.

354
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:51,600
Get out of my palace! You're exiled, you bastard!

355
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:55,400
Banished from the land! You're not welcome here!

356
00:33:55,401 --> 00:34:00,200
You're no son of mine.

357
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,900
Everything, suddenly changed for him,

358
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,400
His father, King Philip, was murdered,

359
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,199
..and Alexander 20

360
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,000
..became the new ruler of Macedonia.

361
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,100
And breaking their treaties with us, dismissing
Alexander as an untried boy,

362
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,299
Several Greek city-states,

363
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,100
rose up in revolt, much to Persia's delight, and

364
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,200
.. half-sponsored by their gold.

365
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,299
And truly Alexander could love like no other,

366
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,999
but to betray him was to arrouse a vast and frightening anger,

367
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,900
..and he massacred several thousand of the
men of that tragic city, Thebes,

368
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:55,699
and sold the survivors into slavery.

369
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,499
This, as intended, stunned and defeated the greeks,

370
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,300
and though in the end he treated
most populations with..magnanimity,

371
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,199
it is these exceptions,

372
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,000
Thebes, Gaza in Syria and later, Persepholis in Persia and others,

373
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,700
..that are always remembered by those
who hate Alexander and all he stood for.

374
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,099
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia

375
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,299
with an army of 40,000 trained men.

376
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,850
And liberating one city state after the other,

377
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:31,400
he conquered all of western Asia, south to Egypt,

378
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:35,400
where he was declared Pharoah of Egypt,

379
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:38,899
worshiped as a god.

380
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,700
It was in Egypt that the respected oracle at Siwah

381
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,000
declared him the true son of Zeus.

382
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,999
He finally provoked Darius himself to battle

383
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,800
in the heart of the Persian empire, near Babylon.

384
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,699
Gaugamela, Persia

385
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,500
It was mad, 40,000 of us against 250,000 barbarians.

386
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,700
It was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.

387
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,999
Alexander. Son of a god.

388
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,800
It was a myth of course, at least it started as a myth,

389
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,900
I know, I was there, I saw his eyes.

390
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,900
There... in the crack of the Persian line, we'll go for the head.

391
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,999
Kill their eyes?

392
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,800
The gods have brought him to us at last!

393
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,999
If I die, it's one Macedonian,

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
..but the Persians they cannot move
with out Darius' command.

395
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:00,499
Here, right here we cut the throat of the Persian army.

396
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,900
This is madness, you will never get withing a hundred paces of him.

397
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:07,100
Have you seen the sheer size of his force, Alexander?

398
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:10,299
Not IF you hold him on the left, my brave Parmenion,

399
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,100
with your son, Philotas, for just one, two hours tomorrow.

400
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,000
And you, unbreakable Antigonus. The center phalanx.

401
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,001
Perdiccas.

402
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:23,802
Leonnatus.

403
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,703
Nearchus.

404
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,204
Polyperchon.

405
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,500
If you pin them on the walls of Ursyrisus here in the center,

406
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,800
their cavalry will follow me out to the right,

407
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:38,299
..and when bold Cassander breaks,

408
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,900
stretching their left, a hole will open,

409
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:45,499
Then I and my cavalry, our revered Cleitus,

410
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,300
Ptolemy and Hephaistion will strike through that gap,

411
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,299
and deal the death blow to Darius' head.

412
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,000
Alexander, even with luck, timing, the
gods, we must route them tomorrow,

413
00:37:58,001 --> 00:37:59,699
destroy their army completely!

414
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,600
..Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes on a long journey home.

415
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:05,599
Right.

416
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,800
You speak of home and retreat,

417
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:14,000
but do you understand, Parmenion,

418
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:18,300
..Babylon is my new home.

419
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:22,599
Alexander, if we must fight,

420
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,199
..do so with stealth, use your numbers well,

421
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,000
we should attack tonight when they least expect us.

422
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,800
I didn't cross Asia to steal this victory, Cassander.

423
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:37,499
No, you are too honorable for that,

424
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,300
No doubt influenced from sleeping with
tales of Troy under your pillow.

425
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,999
But your father was no lover of Homer's.

426
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,300
The lands west of the Euphrates handed over.
The hand of his daughter in marriage,

427
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:53,600
..since when has a greek ever been given such honors?

428
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:57,450
This are not honors, Parmenion. They are bribes!

429
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:01,299
..which the greeks have accepted.. TOO LONG!

430
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,099
Do you forget that the man who murdered
my father lies across the valley floor?

431
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,900
Come Alexander, we are still not really sure
if it was Persian gold behind the assassination.

432
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,800
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason, to your passion.

433
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:21,799
Now I urge you to regroup!

434
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Fall back to the coast, raise a larger force.

435
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:29,400
I would.. if I were Parmenion.

436
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,799
but I am Alexander.

437
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,199
And no more than Earth has two Suns will Asia bear two kings.

438
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,000
These are my terms, and if Darius isn't a
coward who hides behind his men,

439
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,000
..then he will come to me tomorrow,

440
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:51,100
And when he bows down to Greece,

441
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,100
..Alexander'll be merciful.

442
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,401
By Aries' chains he's got balls, Men!

443
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:04,502
And we'll give the man his due, Parmenion!

444
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,200
..and lads feast tonight, for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

445
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,200
To whom do you pray?

446
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,750
Phobos.

447
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,300
Fear.

448
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,301
..a bad omen.

449
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,700
More so for Darius.

450
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,700
I have come to believe that fear of
death drives all men, Hephaistion.

451
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,700
This we didn't learn as school boys.

452
00:40:56,701 --> 00:41:00,200
It is the cause of all our misfortunes.

453
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,800
So, mighty Crateros!

454
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:05,299
Your majesty.

455
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,499
Are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?

456
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,300
Ah, it's been too long coming if you
ask me, I mean...they're skittish as colts.

457
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,899
Good, fear makes men fight better.

458
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,099
Post your sentries alertly, but rest them well.

459
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,300
Don't you worry General, I have been known
to sleep with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

460
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:27,099
Only 'cause someone might steal his loot sire.

461
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,000
After tomorrow even the thrifty among you will shall be kings.

462
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,599
God be with us your majesty.

463
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,700
We'll stain the ground with Persian blood, my king.

464
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,750
I've always believed, Alexander..

465
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,799
..this seems so much bigger than us.

466
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,600
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they
stood side by side at seige of Troy?

467
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,599
Patroclus died first.

468
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,400
If you do, if you were to fall Hephaistion,
even though Macedonia would lose a king,

469
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,200
I will avenge you.. and follow you down to the house of death.

470
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,900
I would do the same.

471
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,600
On the eve of battle it is hardest to be alone.

472
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,799
Then perhaps,

473
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,500
perhaps this is farewell then,

474
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:32,199
my Alexander.

475
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,400
Fear not Hephaistion,

476
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:40,600
we are at the beginning.

477
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,450
Blood makes the world rise.

478
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:20,200
blood makes the rain fall.

479
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,200
blood makes the earth grow.

480
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,699
In blood

481
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,500
..all men are born and die.

482
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,900
Blood is the food of the gods below.

483
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,900
Help me Bucephalus, today we ride to our destiny.

484
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,500
Neoptolemos, I remember you the
day you took the seige tower at Tyre.

485
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,000
You were a giant! And today how will you fight?

486
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,000
Dexippos. By Athena... how far was it you threw
your man wrestling at the last Olympic games?

487
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,000
Will you match it with your spear?

488
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,000
And Timander, son of Menander, a great soldier to my father,

489
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,700
...I still mourn your brother Hodeus,

490
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:36,199
Who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

491
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,700
What an honored family you descend from Timander!

492
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:44,099
You fight for them today.

493
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,900
You have all honored your country and your ancestors,

494
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,800
And now we come to this most distant place in Asia,

495
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,999
Where across from us

496
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,800
Darius has at last gathered a vast army...

497
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,899
But ask yourselves, Who is this great king,

498
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,700
who pays assassins in gold coins to murder my father,

499
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:40,500
our king, in a most despicable, and cowardly manner,

500
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,600
and who is this great King Darius who
enslaves his own men to fight?

501
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,900
Who is this king, but a king of air?

502
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:54,599
These men do not fight for their homes.

503
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,300
They fight because this king tells them they must.

504
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,100
We are here today, as Macedonian free men.

505
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,000
Some of you, perhaps myself,

506
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,800
Will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today,

507
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,200
But I say to you, what every warrior has
known since the beginning of time,

508
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,200
Conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death.

509
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,600
You will answer, I was here this day at Gaugamela,

510
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,500
for the freedom

511
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:31,200
and glory

512
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,100
of Greece!

513
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,900
ZEUS be WITH US!!

514
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,600
Where does he go?

515
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:22,200
Don't know majesty.

516
00:49:22,201 --> 00:49:25,800
Envelope him, Bessos.

517
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,800
He makes a mistake, Fadnippos.

518
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Yes, my king.

519
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,800
Be brave men.

520
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,599
Macedonian Left

521
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,400
...and keep watching the calvary on the left!

522
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,901
Pick up the pace!

523
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,900
Prepare to repel chariots!

524
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,400
Alexander! Go!

525
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,001
Left Turn!

526
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,400
Father! We must fall back to the gally, Father!

527
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:57,401
Hurry and get word to Alexander. MOVE!

528
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,900
Come Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

529
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,700
Break for the hole!

530
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Son!

531
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,899
Go and tell Alexander yourself,

532
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,700
..and if he won't listen, then survive
me, and avenge this betrayal.

533
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,800
Pay attention lad, your father still watches over you!

534
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,099
Darius!

535
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,500
Ride your horses!

536
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,000
Darius!

537
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:19,701
Go! Go!

538
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,100
We can reach those mountains by sunset,

539
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:40,200
..go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

540
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:43,800
Provision the horses!

541
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,499
Alexander, Alexander my father is lost,

542
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,200
..they've overrun the flank and they're into the baggage train!

543
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:51,600
Parmenion's crumbling!

544
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:52,400
Ah!!!!

545
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,400
Alexander if you chase them, you risk losing your army here.

546
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:02,800
And if we capture him we gain an empire.

547
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,700
You can run to the ends of the earth you coward,

548
00:59:11,701 --> 00:59:15,000
But you will never run far enough.

549
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:19,600
To Parmenion!

550
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,500
You bleed free my lord, May I tend to your wound?

551
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,799
No, Hermolaos, not now.

552
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,600
There's far worse than me, go to them, help them.

553
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,699
Your majesty,

554
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,500
You're very brave. What shall I call you?

555
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:19,599
Gloukas, my king.

556
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,700
Gloukas. And where is your home?

557
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:26,999
Illyria.

558
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,899
Let your body go loose.

559
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,700
Think of home now. Be brave again, Gloukas.

560
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,600
and you will live on in glory.

561
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:44,400
Alexander.

562
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,300
The Persian Empire, the greatest the
world had yet known, was destroyed.

563
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,900
And Alexander at 25 was now King of all.

564
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,700
Alexander once said to me, "We are
most alone when we are with the myths."

565
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:36,900
Babylon, Persia

566
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,100
And thus it came to pass in a dream as mythical to all greeks

567
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:43,699
as Achilles defeating the Trojans,

568
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,900
That there is one glorious moment in time,

569
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:51,700
Alexander was loved by all.

570
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,800
But in the end, I believe Babylon was a far easier mistress to enter,

571
01:01:56,801 --> 01:02:01,600
..than she was to leave.

572
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,350
Imagine the minds that conceived this!

573
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:23,599
With architects and engineers like these,

574
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,399
..we can build cities such as we only dreamed.

575
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,199
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon!

576
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,000
We have enough gold here to support another
three generations of Macedonian armies.

577
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,699
Macedonia would soon corrupt, Cassander,

578
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:44,500
..wealth in great quantities brings the crows.

579
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,100
Not for the men who fought I trust?

580
01:03:48,101 --> 01:03:50,899
We'll pay them well, Antigonus.

581
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,800
But not as mercenaries for future services.

582
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,850
Now you sound like Philip.

583
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:58,275
Philip never saw Babylon.

584
01:03:58,276 --> 01:04:01,700
No he didn't, Hefaistion.

585
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,200
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod, but,

586
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:10,850
..whatever our differences, know this day,

587
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:14,500
Your father would be very proud of you.

588
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,399
Thank you, Parmenion.

589
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,700
And I ask you to forgive me, my own anger. My pride.

590
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:26,500
They too, blind me.

591
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,850
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders,

592
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:35,100
..we now rule two million square miles.

593
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,899
Not if we keep giving it all away!

594
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:41,700
But, none of you fear that this great fortune,

595
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,199
..may drive us all to destruction.

596
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,000
You over value us. For as long as Darius
breathes, he is the legitimate King of Asia,

597
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,050
..and I but the king of air.

598
01:04:53,051 --> 01:04:55,799
But he has no power, Alexander!

599
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,699
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

600
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,100
As long as he's lost, Philotas, he can be believed in.

601
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:05,900
Only when he's found will it be decided.

602
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,299
It seems you've already made up your mind, Alexander.

603
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,750
We must finish what we failed to do at Gaugamela, Parmenium.

604
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:13,200
We must hunt Darius down, if it be to the ends of Earth.

605
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,700
That was not your father's mission.

606
01:05:14,701 --> 01:05:19,099
And I am not my father.

607
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,900
Come on, have you so quickly forgotten? Fortune favors the bold!

608
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,499
By the gods! What is this?

609
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,600
A wonder Darius fled, when he had this to come back to!

610
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:36,400
I venture one for every night of the year.

611
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,699
Help me Aphrodite! How will I ever go
back to Lysimacheia after this?

612
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,500
I advise you not to touch the anatomy.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

613
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,199
Aristotle was, perhaps, present.

614
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,000
Do these images fool us with their beauty and degrade our souls?

615
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:18,900
Great King Alexander!

616
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,700
The princess of the thousand roses, and eldest
daughter of the formerly great King Darius.

617
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,799
Stateira!

618
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,600
Noble Alexander.

619
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,000
I come to beg for the lives of my sisters,

620
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,900
my mother, my grandmother.

621
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,500
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

622
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:59,300
He, too, is Alexander.

623
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,000
Please, I plead for my families lives,

624
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,900
sell me as a slave, great king, but please..

625
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:13,300
Look now, in my eyes,

626
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:16,299
Princess,

627
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:21,100
and tell me, how would you like to be treated?

628
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,800
As I am, a princess.

629
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:35,100
Then so be it. You and your family shall be treated as my family.

630
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,100
You shall live in this palace as long as you choose,

631
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:47,400
Have you any other requests for me my noble Princess?

632
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:53,300
No, everything I wish,

633
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,600
I have...

634
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:03,399
Requested.

635
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:08,200
You truly are a queen.

636
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,950
Yes, she would be a perfect match for you, but you do nothing.

637
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,200
Three months you have been in Babylon,
and leave me in Pella,

638
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:25,999
..at the mercy of your enemies, of which you have many.

639
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,500
Antipater, accustomed now to the
power that you have given him,

640
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:34,300
I must watch him grow stronger.

641
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,399
I am certain that he communicates secretly with Parmenion,

642
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:45,200
..who is dangerous. But beware most of all of those closest to you,

643
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,400
They are like snakes and can be turned.

644
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:53,399
General Crateros!

645
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,199
Cassander is Antipater's son.

646
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,000
Even Cleitus, your fathers favorite.

647
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:03,699
And Ptolemy, your friend, yes,

648
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:08,400
..but beware of men who think too much, they blind themselves.

649
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,999
Only Hephaistion do I leave out,

650
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,800
..but all of them you make rich, while your mother and yourself,

651
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,750
You leave in generous poverty.

652
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:27,199
Why won't you ever believe me?

653
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:32,000
It is only a dark mind like mine that
can know these secrets of the heart.

654
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,800
For they are dark, Alexander.

655
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:39,999
So dark. But in you,

656
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,350
..the son of Zeus, lies the light of the world!

657
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:48,125
Your companions will be shadows in the underworld,

658
01:10:48,126 --> 01:10:51,413
..when you are a name living forever in history,

659
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,700
..as the most glorious shining light of youth.

660
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:57,499
Forever young. Forever inspiring!

661
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,100
Never will there be an Alexander like you,

662
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:04,699
Alexander the Great!

663
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,199
Remember, bring me to Babylon as you promised.

664
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,500
I can only help you, for they know if they harm you,

665
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:16,300
..they will face my wrath, as Queen of Babylon.

666
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:20,600
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months lodging in the womb.

667
01:11:20,601 --> 01:11:24,700
Bring her, Alexander. It will give her such joy!

668
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:26,401
Joy?

669
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,200
..and on the cracked mirror of her dreams.

670
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,900
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

671
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,800
I'll take my own bath. Thank you, Bagoas.

672
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,099
The generals question your obsession with Darius.

673
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,499
They say it was never meant for you to be King of Asia.

674
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,399
Naturally. They want only to return
to their homes, rich with gold.

675
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,200
But I've seen the future, Hephaistion!
I've seen it now a thousand times, on a thousand faces.

676
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,500
These people want, need change.

677
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,200
Aristotle was wrong about them.

678
01:12:26,201 --> 01:12:27,799
How so?

679
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,199
Look at those we have conquered. They leave their dead unburied,

680
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:37,000
They smash their enemies skulls and drink
from it's dust, they mate in public,

681
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,099
What can they think, or sing or write, when none can read?

682
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,800
But as Alexander's army they can go
where they never thought possible!

683
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:49,899
They can soldier, work in the cities,

684
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:54,499
the Alexandrias, from Egypt to the outer ocean.

685
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,499
We can connect these lands, Hephaistion! And the people,

686
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,300
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself,

687
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,099
They draw people into the cities so as to make slaves.

688
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,900
But we've freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves!

689
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,199
To free the people of the world,

690
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,750
..such would be beyond the glory of Achilles.

691
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:24,300
Beyond Heracles! A feat to rival Prometheus,

692
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,899
..who was always a friend to man.

693
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:32,400
Remember the fates of these heroes. They suffered greatly.

694
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:37,200
Oh we all suffer. Your father, mine.

695
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,499
They all came to the end of their time,

696
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,800
..and in the end, when it's over, all that
matters is what you've done.

697
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:51,100
You once said the fear of death drives all men,

698
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,099
Are there no other forces?

699
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,300
Is there not love in your life?

700
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:03,100
Alexander?

701
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:11,500
I wonder sometimes, if it is not your mother you run from,

702
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,800
So many years, so many miles between you,

703
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,800
What is it you fear?

704
01:14:21,801 --> 01:14:25,300
Who knows these things?

705
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,200
When I was a child, my mother thought me devine, my father weak.

706
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,500
Which am I, Hephaistion?

707
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:40,199
Weak or Divine?

708
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,000
All I know is I trust only you in this world,

709
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,100
I've missed you. I need you.

710
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,900
It is you I love Hephaistion, no other.

711
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,000
You still hold your head cocked,

712
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,699
Like that,

713
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,899
I have stopped that.

714
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,200
No like a deer listening in the wind,

715
01:15:09,201 --> 01:15:13,150
You strike me still Alexander.

716
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:17,099
You have eyes like no other,

717
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,900
Oh, I sounded stupid as school boy,

718
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,199
You're everything I care for,

719
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,199
..and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite,

720
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,400
I am so jealous of losing you to this world you want so badly.

721
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:37,600
You'll never lose me Hephaistion,

722
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:41,100
I will be with you always,

723
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:45,900
until the end.

724
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,100
Northeastern Persia

725
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,599
The campaign in the northeast of Persia..

726
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,400
..turned into a hard guerilla war of almost three years.

727
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,100
We chased Darius towards Bactria, but missed taking him by hours.

728
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,300
He was dying when we found him sire,

729
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:21,800
He asked for water, he drank and died.

730
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,600
The great king Darius had been betrayed by his own commanders.

731
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,199
Fully honoring his corpse,

732
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,000
Alexander hunted down these commanders to unknown lands.

733
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:11,700
Crossing even beyond the river Oxos, into Sogdia.

734
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,300
We fought them as far as the unknown steppes of Scythia,

735
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,799
Where only legendary heroes had once taught.

736
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:28,600
The surveyors told us we were now in the
borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

737
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,699
In fact, we were totally lost.

738
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,599
Here Alexander founded his tenth Alexandria,

739
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,400
..and settled it with veterans, their women, and
any who would dare the frontier life.

740
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,499
Unable to accept defeat in any form,

741
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,199
Alexander persisted in breaking every tribe that resisted,

742
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:55,000
Until the day he received the head of his last enemy in surrender.

743
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,600
For Alexander, there could be no pretender to the throne of Asia,

744
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:09,000
..which now included all of Sogdia and Bactria.

745
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,200
It was here that Alexander made one
of his most mysterious decisions.

746
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,600
Her eyes tell me, she cares for you Alexander,

747
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,699
Perhaps too much.

748
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,299
In the ways of my country,

749
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,900
Those who love too much, lose everything,

750
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:08,700
Those who love with irony, last.

751
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
Your father must been turning in his grave Alexander,

752
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:26,400
After all this time, a hill Chief's daughter.

753
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:28,800
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit!

754
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:30,400
And what's the point Alexander?

755
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:32,000
Just take her as your concubine.

756
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:33,550
Because I want a son,

757
01:20:33,551 --> 01:20:35,099
Damn you, Philotas.

758
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,300
But then half your nobles have sisters
you'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

759
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,300
To take an Asian as my queen not a captive,

760
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:43,299
Is a sign of deep respect for our subjects,

761
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,900
It will, more than anything, bring us together, unify us.

762
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:48,500
Which is not to say I won't take a Macedonian one day.

763
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,399
As a second wife, and insult Macedonia.

764
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,100
Alexander! This is about the HONOR of our kingdom.

765
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,399
Exactly, what can be won Alexander?

766
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,700
We came here to Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

767
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:03,199
Seven years from home,

768
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,199
Now we drift from one far region to another,

769
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,500
Chasing nomads and bandits, when
Macedonia bleeds it's manpower..

770
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:13,800
For what? To build roads in Asia? To give these people cities?

771
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:17,200
To found cities, and expand our reach is not to drift Parmenion.

772
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:18,500
What benefit to Macedon?

773
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:19,750
It's far richer than before!

774
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:20,999
Look what you give them!

775
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,500
With respect for your age, Parmenion,
had you fought better at Gaugamela,

776
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:25,400
..when your flank was crumbling, we could have had Darius.

777
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:26,899
How dare you Nearchus!

778
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,099
GENERAL Nearchus to you boy.

779
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:33,900
Alexander spread our flag too thin! There was
nothing my father, any of you could have done.

780
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Sit down.

781
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:43,900
Alexander, I have known you since you were born,

782
01:21:43,901 --> 01:21:46,750
I supported you at your father's death.

783
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:49,599
At the very least, for Zeus's sake,

784
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,700
..and in respect to the council that chose you king,

785
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:57,500
Give us a Macedonian heir. A MACEDONIAN heir.

786
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,500
You have been heard clearly.

787
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:06,699
PARMENION!

788
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,299
And after the wedding you will take brigades back to Babylon,

789
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,100
Where I look to you, and Antipater in Greece,
to maintain our empire and supply this expedition.

790
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,899
I will away to the north with my advance army at Marakand.

791
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,800
And I pray to Apollo you soon realize how far
you've turned from your father's path!

792
01:22:21,801 --> 01:22:24,400
Ah damn you Parmenion by the gods and your Apollo!

793
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:26,099
What was in my father's guts?

794
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,899
Was it over ripened reason like yours?

795
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,799
He never lusted for war Alexander!.. or enjoyed it so!

796
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,600
He consulted his peers in counsel, among
equals, hmmn? The Macedonian way.

797
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,950
He didn't make decisions based on his personal desires.

798
01:22:39,951 --> 01:22:42,900
I have taken us further than my father ever dreamed.

799
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:47,700
Old man, we are in new worlds.

800
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:51,399
Alexander, be reasonable!

801
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,899
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

802
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:57,999
Share our rewards? You remember what Aristotle said,

803
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,800
An Asian? What would a wedding vow ever mean
to a race that has never kept their word to a Greek?

804
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,399
Aristotle be damned!

805
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,899
By Zeus and all the gods,

806
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:11,199
What makes you so much better than them, Cassander?

807
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:16,000
Better than you really are, in you and those like you is this.

808
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,999
Alexander.

809
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,800
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgement,

810
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,600
..It's your contempt for a world far older than ours.

811
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:50,100
And so ten years after his mother's
insistence he marry a Macedonian,

812
01:23:50,101 --> 01:23:53,300
Our union, Greek and barbarian,

813
01:23:53,301 --> 01:23:56,499
The most powerful man in the world,

814
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:01,300
..took a girl of no political significance. Why?

815
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,200
Some say it was for alliance with the tribes.

816
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,799
Others, the desire for a successor,

817
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,600
And yet others said Alexander truly fell in love.

818
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,899
Who Roxane really was,

819
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:30,700
I doubt that any of us ever saw further than
the pools of those black eyes.

820
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:38,500
Alexander. Special for you!

821
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,199
On this glorious occasion,

822
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,999
I toast this great army that has given so much,

823
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,200
And in honor of them, those of you who
set out with us seven long years ago,

824
01:24:54,201 --> 01:24:59,000
I pronounce, all your debts paid forthwith from the royal treasury.

825
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,800
And in honor of my bride,

826
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:11,299
My beautiful bride,

827
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,700
We recognize the many women who
shared the long hard road with us,

828
01:25:15,701 --> 01:25:20,500
I grant them doweries befitting a proper marriage.

829
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,899
But what about our boys?

830
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:30,700
And lastly, lastly the gods demand no less of us,

831
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,100
That your children with these women be
given a proper greek education,

832
01:25:34,101 --> 01:25:36,400
and military training,

833
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:38,699
Under our protection,

834
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:43,500
..so as to be the new soldiers of our kingdom in Asia.

835
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,499
I found it in Egypt,

836
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,799
The man that sold it to me said,

837
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,300
..it came from a time when man worshipped sun and stars.

838
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,400
I'll always think of you..

839
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,999
as the sun, Alexander,

840
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,600
And I pray your dream will shine on all men.

841
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:01,700
I wish you a son! You're a great man!

842
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,800
You love him?

843
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:42,700
He is Hephaistion.

844
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:58,700
There are many different ways to love Roxane, come.

845
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:08,000
You have no fear,

846
01:29:08,001 --> 01:29:11,099
it's fitting,

847
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,400
..a man searches for a woman at Earth's top,

848
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:19,200
And finds her.

849
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,900
The myth becomes real.

850
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,700
Great man, scared?

851
01:29:49,701 --> 01:29:54,100
You I kill now.

852
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,500
Do it! End it!

853
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:02,701
I would do the same.

854
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,000
I'll die a fool, for this..

855
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,500
love.

856
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,100
My life is now yours.

857
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,800
You will have my son.

858
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:03,400
Who is this woman you call your queen, Alexander?

859
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:08,200
A hill girl? You with your breeding,

860
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:13,200
Already she makes enemies, with her strong, clumsy nature,

861
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:21,100
Do not confuse us, I was never a barbarian as Philip said,

862
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,000
We are of Achilles royal blood,

863
01:32:26,001 --> 01:32:30,399
Zeus is your father.

864
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,450
Oh I understand. She brings you some happiness,

865
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:38,499
But hear me when I tell you act, and act soon,

866
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,900
And after seven years, people wonder,
"..who is this king Alexander?"

867
01:32:42,901 --> 01:32:44,999
I have given you ample proof,

868
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,700
Antipater daily undermines your authority,

869
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:51,650
Return to Babylon and strengthen your center,

870
01:32:51,651 --> 01:32:55,475
Or come home to Macedonia and reorganize,

871
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:59,300
But do not chase your dream further east!

872
01:32:59,301 --> 01:33:03,700
Your life, and mine depend on it.

873
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:05,599
Remember

874
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,299
my only thoughts are of you,

875
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,450
As you, too, must face your glorious destiny,

876
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:17,675
Think kindly of your mother. Provide for me,

877
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:21,900
protect me from your enemies when you are gone,

878
01:33:21,901 --> 01:33:24,999
And remember always,

879
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,800
..it is I who loves you more than any.

880
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,200
If only you were not a pale reflection from my mother's heart.

881
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,100
Who did this?

882
01:34:20,101 --> 01:34:22,050
Tell me.

883
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:23,999
Hermolaos

884
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,800
Never will you find a man as devoted as I...

885
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:32,199
The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander,

886
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,800
Not only because it involved the young
pages, who'd shared his dream,

887
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:40,699
But, more intimately, it implicated Philotas,

888
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:45,500
His companion from boyhood, who was
captain of Alexander's royal guards.

889
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:51,100
Alexander, remember me for who I am.

890
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,499
I do remember you Philotas, but not
as you remember yourself.

891
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:59,100
It appears to me and your peers here that
true weather of your soul is ambition.

892
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:00,099
NO...

893
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,399
None of us defended Philotas,

894
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,399
..But then again, none of us ever liked him,

895
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:10,200
And of course his power was carved up by the rest of us.

896
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,999
Before he died, we tortured him,

897
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,400
To find out what his father Parmenion knew,

898
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:25,499
But this we never learned,

899
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,800
But what to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supply lines,

900
01:35:29,801 --> 01:35:31,900
was a far more delicate matter,

901
01:35:31,901 --> 01:35:33,499
Was he innnocent in this?

902
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,300
..or had he decided to act before age
further withered his power?

903
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,499
We'll be divided.

904
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,000
The men will follow their king.

905
01:35:42,001 --> 01:35:44,799
Alexander won't be there.

906
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,199
Necessity required Alexander to act,

907
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,000
And he'd sealed the camp within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

908
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,300
Then go Antigonus. And Cleitus.

909
01:35:58,301 --> 01:36:01,399
..and go quickly.

910
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:06,200
Three days hard riding sent Antigonus and Cleitus to Parmenion.

911
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,899
His soldiers accepted the finding of guilt against Parmenion,

912
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:18,700
As they understood that the head of
family is responsible for the behavior of all.

913
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,600
Cleitus, Antigonus.

914
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:57,799
I remember a remark of Bagoas' once,

915
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:01,700
That love eluded Alexander as much, if not more,

916
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:06,500
..than finding the end of the world.

917
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,400
In the spring, Alexander marched an army of 150,000,

918
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:18,000
Across the passes of the Hindu Kush,

919
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:21,200
Into the unknown,

920
01:38:21,201 --> 01:38:23,701
In his dream, It was the promised route..
